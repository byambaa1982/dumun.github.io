	<p>Our specialised team has the skill and experience to provide a range of services. The utmost care is taken with all our work. The main streams of work we perform are as follows:</p>

	<h3>Painting</h3>
	<p>
		The color scheme that is chosen for the home creates the initial impression that an individual has of the premises as a whole.  Whether complimentary or unflattering colors are selected, the house will gain an identity of its own when the paint is applied.  There are many times that a homeowner misses opportunities to accentuate positive attributes that the home has to offer by failing to choose the best exterior paint colors. 
	</p>

	<p>Picking exterior house paint colors is a lot different than picking a color for a shirt or a car.  It may help to drive around to observe colors that other homeowners have combined on homes that are of similar size and design as yours.  There are also online resources that provide homeowners with the ability to create virtual makeovers of their home by combining colors together through their software programs as well.</p>

	<h3>Siding</h3>
	<p>
		Any experienced siding replacement professional will tell you that quality matters. All too often, however, those very same siding contractors end up cutting corners and lowering standards just to save a few bucks!.
	</p>

	<p>In Chicago’s variable climate, siding plays a dual role of elevating curb appeal and property value while also insulating your home from extreme weather events. That’s why choosing reputable siding manufacturers is so important to your long-term satisfaction</p>
